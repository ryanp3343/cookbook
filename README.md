# CookBook

## Overview 

The CookBook app is intended to be a social media platform for chefs and at home cooks to share recipes and engage in public forums. Users may upload their own recipes and save other recipes to a favorites list. People can also create forums for any questions or techniques other people can implement when cooking their recipes. People may freely comment on other forums to provide instant feedback. While posting recipes, users may also upload images to showcase their final products and demonstrate what is expected.
